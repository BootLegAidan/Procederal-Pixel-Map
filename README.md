Just a little map generator I made in a couple hours one night. There are some stuff you can change in config.js to do some interesting stuff. It supports adding custom terrain types, all that is really needed is a color and a height to display the type at. The names are messy, but they were just there while I was making the terrain types

**Controls**

 - WASD - Pan Camera
 - Minus/equals - Zoom out/in
 - Less than/greater than - Decrease/increase quality (if it take longer
than 41ms to load a frame, the quality automatically decreases a
little bit
 - Up/down arrow - Morph terrain
 - You can drag your mouse and scroll
   up/down to pan/zoom now
